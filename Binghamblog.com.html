               <h2 class="post-title">Story at Bingham University</h2>
               <p class="post-content">As a student in Bingham University, i have had a lot of bad experiences at first let me be frank because when i  got admitted into the school , i was confused because i was scared about where to go,
               where lecturers where to take lectures, the name of some of the lectures and so many other things. It got so bad that i started to miss some classes thinking i was never ready for the university but it was just fear of entering a new school, thinking i was never going to be they best in the school. Honestly if you ask me it has been a crazy
			   rollercoaster for me in the university. But i thanked God for my life and everything in school, when i got to my first class they lecturer who took that particular class was a very nice man. 
         Made they class very lively and i loved it . They next class that i loved so much was BHUCMP103 which was taken by Mr k aka (Mr Kunle).
		 Believe me when i got through those sliding glass doors, i was scared i did not know what was going to happen next. I just had to move with the flo just you know go to where you see and empty seat and answer questions where necessary. I
         was shocked to have even be voted and accepted into power in his course. It was one of my most memorable moments in Bingham university. I
        took that position with seriousness and put my best into it always made Mr K proud and very happy. Thank you so much Mr k for making my experience
		in Bingham university so amazing. I have so many favourite teachers in Bingham university e.g like Mr Aremu , Mr Lawal , Dr Francais , and Dr lenzy peters. There are so many of the but i do not want to mention all of them..
		 have been better if i had just come and relaxed , understood the school environment and just had gone with the flow but honestly if you asked me the school is amazing i love my experience and stay quite well.

				<h3 class="post-title">Chills at Bingham University</h3>
				Bingham has been so lovely and amazing by the way in the case of sports, parties and reading experience.
				When i first came to Bingham i heard of matriculation, prevocation , and even fresher party..
                Now let me explain so you understand more at the matriculation party is just mostly introduction to Bingham university telling us about the rules, regulations and you know things like that. 
				It was that day i herd about something called "Handbook" aka  "2 Bible" this book just illstrates all about the rules , regulations in Bingham university things to avoid and things you ca do like for example
				there i no smartphone allowed in the university and so on. At starting most of they rules will make you feel afraid but with time you will get used to the rules of the school and you will just know tht you will need to avoid some things and that mostly it with the Matriculation party... 
	            Prevocation just similar to matriculation except parents came to visit their children and brought a lot of goodies you know to avoid hunger in school... 	
			</div>  
				Fresher party "ALL HAIL FRESHER PARTY " They maddest craziest most intresting party ever they party was dupe mostly for new students only. People had fun just know things sup u get na things on things like how our guy "Yul Edochie" go say Mad ohhh.. Party just dey made like it was amazing people who missed this party make sure you do not miss they next one coming upp cos i will be attending it and i know it will be dupe.

				Lastly
			My overall experience in Bingham University have been great, there have been times where i have had up and downs alot let me be honest.
		 But i took it upon myself to get better improve mentally and i know now i have been able to stand firmly on my ground knowing i would not shake an i have a good stable background . I would not have done all this except through "Christ who strengthens me"	..
	     I am grateful to God for everything he has done for me and i know he will continue to do more for me..
